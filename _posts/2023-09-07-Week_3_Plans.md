This week I'm planning to do my second live review, and then get ready for my peer showcase. I plan to also make more changes to my webpage aswell as clean up my main cover page. Last week Mr. Lopez also mentioned that we are going to need to change our repostiory, and update it because the one Mr. Mortensen has was updated and isn't up to date.
