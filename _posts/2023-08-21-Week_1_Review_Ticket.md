## Week 1 Review Ticket
This week I learned much about Vscode, Github, and how everything is going to work. I was able to setup all of the requirements for vscode, aswell as github. I learned that we will be creating a webpage, which we can add different things like games, a notebook of our work, and other things. I was able to do my first live review, which I showed that my webpage was able to work properly, and that I had added all of the requirements of the week. 

## 2nd Week Review Ticket
This week we learned about different Python Tricks, aswell as how to make other outputs using Jquery to make a table. Using the template from the code I made a table that included the top 10 countries in the world in 2021, which included sections for the companies, CEO's, and net worth. I was also able to create a snake game, which they provided the code and I was able to copy and paste it into a post.
