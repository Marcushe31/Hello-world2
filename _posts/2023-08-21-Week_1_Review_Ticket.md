## Week 1 Review Ticket
This week I learned much about Vscode, Github, and how everything is going to work. I learned that we will be creating a webpage, which we can add different things like games, a notebook of our work, and other things. I was able to do my first live review, which I showed that my webpage was able to work properly, and that I had added all of the requirements of the week.
