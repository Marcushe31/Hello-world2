This week, I learned some more things and hacks about HTML, and JavaScript. With the code given to us, I was able to create a quiz with the help of chat GPT. To add to this, I was able to look up online the code in HTML to create a PacMan game, which I was able to add to my Webpage. This week I was able to work more on my page and change my theme to the basic one, beacuse I didn't like the look of the other themese that I had. This is the review for week 3!
