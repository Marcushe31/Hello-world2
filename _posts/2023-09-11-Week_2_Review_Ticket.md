## 2nd Week Review Ticket
This week we learned about different Python Tricks, aswell as how to make other outputs using Jquery to make a table. Using the template from the code I made a table that included the top 10 countries in the world in 2021, which included sections for the companies, CEO's, and net worth. I was also able to create a snake game, which they provided the code and I was able to copy and paste it into a post.
