<h2> Summary of the Week </h2>
This week I learned lots more about the linux shell, and bash. While I was not able to get my peer showcase done because my partner Hau wasn't here, I will plan to get ready for the team test that we have next week in groups of 4. I was also able to learn on Thursday about agile methodology, and how we are going to implement it into the team text that we have next week and how it will be useful in the future. Next week will be a short week, but I am hoping to learn more!
