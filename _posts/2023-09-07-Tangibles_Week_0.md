During the first week, I had lots of trouble setting up my page and getting all of the technical stuff done in my terminal for Vscode and Github. I had to restart my repository a couple of times just so that I could get github to work. I learned some basic commands to use in terminal such as:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Command</th>
    <th>What it does</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cd</td>
    <td>Change directory in the terminal</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ls</td>
    <td>Shows list in the directory</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Vscode</td>
    <td>Once installed, can change directory to vscode</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Make</td>
    <td>Creates server "Webpage" online</td>
</tr>
   <td></td>
